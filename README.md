# Dukkha
A RAG for introductory Buddhism practice.

## Quickstart

1. Create a `.env` alongside `.env.example` and populate all fields.
2. Add source PDF documents to `dat/` for indexing.
3. Run `poetry run python app.py` to launch the Gradio interface.

## Notes

I am primarily referencing "No-Nonsense Buddhism For Beginners", a book I already own in physical form. To disseminate that PDF form here would, in my opinion, align with neither Right Action nor Right Intention. Please pay for the source material you use, if applicable :^)
